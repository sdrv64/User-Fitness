User-Fitness is a full-stack app for tracking reps, calories, and weight. It blends a snappy React frontend with a solid Node.js backend. The app stores user data in MongoDB and uses charts to visualize progress over time. It aims to be simple to set up, easy to extend, and friendly to beginners while staying practical for power users.

This repository holds a complete stack that covers user authentication, form validation, data validation, API routing, and responsive UI. It leverages modern tooling and best practices to give you a solid foundation for your own fitness projects or for building a personal health tracker.

Overview
- Client: React with hooks, React Router, and Tailwind CSS for fast, responsive UI.
- Server: Express-based API with REST endpoints, CORS support, and environment-driven configuration.
- Data: MongoDB with Mongoose for solid data modeling and validation.
- UI/UX: Chart.js for visual progress, React Hook Form for intuitive forms, and Toastify for friendly notifications.

The project is designed to be a learning platform as well as a practical starter kit. It demonstrates how to structure a modern full-stack project, how to manage state across client and server, and how to handle common tasks like authentication, data validation, and error handling.

Visuals and assets

How to run locally: a deeper guide
- Backend setup
  - Create a local MongoDB instance or connect to a hosted one
  - Ensure the database URL is configured in server/.env
  - Run the server in development mode to see detailed logs
  - Use environment variables to toggle features (e.g., debug mode, allowed origins)
- Frontend setup
  - Tailwind CSS is configured for rapid styling
  - Forms are built with React Hook Form and validated with a mix of UI validation and server-side checks
  - Charts render data from API endpoints; you can experiment with different time ranges
- Common workflows
  - Adding a workout entry
  - Recording calories or weight
  - Generating progress charts over a chosen period
  - Importing or exporting data (CSV/JSON) for personal records
- Debugging tips
  - Check console logs in the browser for UI issues
  - Inspect network requests in the browser's developer tools to verify API responses
  - Review server logs for authentication or database errors
  - Validate environment variables when the app fails to connect to the database

API design and endpoints
- Base URL
  - The API adheres to REST principles and uses clear resource-oriented routes
- Core resources
  - Users: create, authenticate, fetch profile, update profile
  - Workouts: create, read, update, delete; supports time-based queries
  - Calories: track daily intake with time stamps and notes
  - Weight: capture weight entries with optional body fat % and notes
  - Settings: user preferences, theme, and notification options
- Request patterns
  - JSON payloads for create and update
  - Validated on the server with Mongoose schemas
  - Validation errors return 400 with a descriptive message
- Security considerations
  - JWT-based authentication
  - Protected routes require a valid token
  - Input validation to prevent injection and XSS
  - CORS configured to only allow trusted origins in production

Data models and validation
- User model
  - Fields: email, password hash, name, createdAt, settings
  - Validation: email format, password strength, unique email
- Workout model
  - Fields: userId, date, type (e.g., push-ups, squats), reps, weight, notes
  - Validation: required fields for date and type; numeric ranges for reps and weight
- Calories model
  - Fields: userId, date, calories, mealDetails
  - Validation: calories must be a positive integer
- Weight model
  - Fields: userId, date, weight, bodyFat
  - Validation: realistic ranges for weight; optional bodyFat
- Relationships
  - Each record is linked to a user via userId
  - Aggregations and charts rely on these relations for daily, weekly, and monthly views

Security and privacy
- Data handling
  - Personal information is stored securely in MongoDB
  - Passwords are hashed and never stored in plain text
  - Sensitive settings are protected by authentication
- Environment separation
  - Different settings for development, staging, and production
  - Secrets stored safely in environment variables
- Access control
  - Only authenticated users can access profile and health data
  - Public endpoints are kept to a minimum and strictly read-only when possible

Testing and quality assurance
- Unit tests
  - Target core utilities and data validation logic
  - Mock external services to ensure deterministic tests
- Integration tests
  - Validate end-to-end flows from API to database
  - Ensure security and authentication behave as expected
- Linting and formatting
  - ESLint rules enforce consistent code style
  - Prettier formats code in a consistent manner
- Continuous integration
  - Tests run on push and pull requests to main branches
  - Linting, building, and tests are automated in CI
- Performance checks
  - Lightweight benchmarks for API responses
  - Basic profiling for front-end rendering speed
